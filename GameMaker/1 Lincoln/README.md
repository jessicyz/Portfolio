# A Lincoln to the Past

I made this before I even knew programming. Due to reasons*, I had to learn how to use Game Maker in less than 3 days (Shaun Spalding, I thank you for your service). 
This was the first large project I ever worked on, and was actually what sparked my interest in CS outside of a means to an end

*\*Funny story about this game, we had three weeks to work on a report in any form of media, and I made this in the last three days. My original project was a dating sim in Ren’Py where you play as Abraham Lincoln, a transfer student in AMERICA High School, and try to woo English teacher Thomas Jefferson, Economics teacher Alexander Hamilton, genius alcoholic vagrant Benjamin Franklin, or the secret candidate, Principal Washington. I think at one point, you could also go after your homeroom teacher John Adams’s son. Your best friend was John Jay
Unfortunately, my group members (the artist and the self-proclaimed author) decided to work on a different project last minute, so I pulled a couple all-nighters (which were genuinely fun) to make this from scratch*
