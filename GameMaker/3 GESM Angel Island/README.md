# Angel Island
This was a "simulation" I made for my Storytelling and Empathy in US Law class

This was my first top down view game. Unlike my other games, I didn't completely rely on (new) tutorials, and instead used what I learned from prior experience and CSCI 103/104.
I meant to make this much bigger than it ended up being. When I realized I neither had the time nor interest to make an entire map, events, and 70+ days of unique dialogue, I cut my losses and simplified it to just a few rooms.
