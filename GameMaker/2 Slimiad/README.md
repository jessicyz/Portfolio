# Slimiad

My final project for APCS

I am so proud of Slimiad. I improved leaps and bounds since Lincoln, and tried so many new things out

This was the first time I created an actual save system that would keep track of not only your map, but your position and stats. Now that I know JSON, I'm thinking of going back and expanding it into a full game, which wouldn't be too hard

I made this with scalability in mind this time, so if I so choose to, I could add more forms and mobs, design new levels, create a collectables/achievement system, and anything else I come up with

Other things I added: Animation, sprite flipping, state machines, dialogue boxes, variable jumping, ledge checking, and all that good stuff that everyone but me put in their first games already
